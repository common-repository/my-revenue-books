A plugin that will make your record keeping of online advertising a lot easier.


== Description ==

This is a plugin that I personally use to manage online advertising for websites.  I thought it might be useful to others.  So if you have a website that generates revenue through online advertising, then this plugin might help you keep track of it.  Website advertising can be hard to keep up with by using the normal record keeping software, but My Revenue Books(MRB) is meant for websites that have a lot of online advertising and/or plans to choose from.  MRB allows you to keep track of unlimited advertising plans and transactions.  MRB is complete with reminders, email reminder capabilities and reports that export to excel to organize your cash flow online and offline.  MRB is designed to keep track of your online advertising, but it could be used for other purposes.
